## Trivia Quiz App

This is a mini-quiz app built using React Hooks.

### Overview

This project was built while learning React Basics (Hooks, JSX, Function Components) in Scrimba's Frontend Career Path course. The project uses Open Trivia database API to pull 5 random questions. The App uses State hook to 
manage screen changes instead of routes. The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### Solo Project Challenge

### Learnings

This was a great project to get hands on experience working with React Hooks. Also learnt about library [html-entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities#user-content-decodetext-options)
to decode HTML entities in the json response from API. A great experience with Array methods to insert correct answer within array of incorrect answers. I used radio inputs with reduced opacity and made it appear 
like option buttons which turned out to be a great learning. The major learning was to keep a track of both correct and clicked answer so the outcome can be shown in green and red colors. It was super enjoyable project
to work on.

Much Gratitude to Scrimba Mentors and Code Reviewers for their guidance on this project and Frontend Development Path in general
